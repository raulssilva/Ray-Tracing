# About the project
This project is part of my studies on Ray Tracing and it follows the three books of [Ray Tracing in One Weekend series](https://github.com/RayTracing/raytracing.github.io).

My first contact with Ray Tracing was in the Computer Science graduation at the Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Norte - Brazil. It was a course of 6 months for Computer Graphics. The teacher discoverd those books and started to studing them with us. On the 6 months we were able to deeply learn the entire first book ([Ray Tracing in One Weekend](https://raytracing.github.io/v3/books/RayTracingInOneWeekend.html)). We build a program in C++ following each part of the book.

That study was made nearby 2018, when the hardware resources were starting to be designed to render some images using Ray Tracing. Nowaday, we have powerfull machines, like PS5, NVIDIA RTX Graphic Boards, and so on. Considering the current scenario and also considering that I love 3D animations, like the Pixar movies, I'll try to fill this repository with a set of modules designed to build realistic images using Ray Tracing and, maybe, be able to create some animations using nothing more then coding.

Since I already build a version with C++, and considering that I'm in love with Python language, I decided to code this project in Python 3.
